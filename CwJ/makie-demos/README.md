# Demos

A collection of little demos made using Makie graphics, which allows interactivity through the dragging of points or the use of simple controls.

* `tangent-line`: see how the slope of secant line converges to the slope of the tangent line as `h` goes to 0

* `optimization`: Identify the optimal crossing point to minimize time when there are different velocities north and south of the x axis.

* `inscribed-area`: Identify the maximal inscribed rectangle

* `integration`: Compare visually the left Riemann approximation, the trapezoid method, and Simpson's method for different values of `n`.

* `spirograph`: adjust parameters for the plotting of spirograph(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph) patterns.

* `bezier`: create Bezier curves by dragging control points.
